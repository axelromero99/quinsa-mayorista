 :collision:E-commerce for a new wholesale clothing enterprise of Argentina:collision:<br>

</h1>

This site was made on TiendaNube ( which is an e-commerce platform with a complete system and apps behind ) because of a few of reasons: we need a FAST deploy, with a complete system of e-commerce. The owner of the enterprise have already created one, so i make it an complete functionally and well designed web page. I also taught myself a lot of marketing ( and im still doing that ) and get into the management of marketing campaigns using Facebook Business, Instagram and Google Ads. I'm in charge of all the web presence and technologic implementations of the enterprise now, as a Fullstack Web Developer. Pretty soon, the plan is to migrate TiendaNube to Wordpress with Woocommerce and other plugins.
